mvalue
by Marc Lepage


OVERVIEW

This C++ code attempts to create a class similar to an STL container like vector or valarray, but with the ability to dynamically change its element type via the Usual Arithmetic Conversions.

Because it uses proxy iterators, it can never be a truly conforming STL container (vector<bool> also suffers this fate). However, it's close enough that many STL algorithms work.

It uses some template magic to make the UACs work.

Originally written in April 2007, it remains a work in progress.
